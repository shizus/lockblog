# Lockblog
This is a django web app designed as a learning project. Its purpose is to deliver a blogging platform tailored specificly for highly sensitive material, such as investigative journalists work, legal evidence or sensitive scientific research papers.
The idea is to develop a platform which will allow users to upload and store sensitive material and keep it safe even in
the event that the user is being pressured to delete the material or if the user has been left unable to publish it.
It is a collaborative effort among people who wish to learn certain programming technologies while solving a real-world problem.

We will be using the following technologies: python, nodejs, gruntjs, sass, git, django, cucumber, docker and a few api's, including the api of google, facebook, twitter, paypal, stripe and google drive.

Our development team is:
